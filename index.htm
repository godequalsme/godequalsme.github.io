<h3 style="color:cyan;" id="why-does-music-feel-good">WHAT IS THE NEVILLE WAY OF HANDLING THE CORONA CRISIS?</h3>
<p style="color:pink; font-weight: bold;"> Please remember that everything in this world is an inevitable bridge towards something better. When you were born into this world, you created new beliefs that were optimal at the time and that have set the path for your destiny. However, by imagining, we can take control of our destiny; we can create new beliefs that are more suitable for us in this time, to create the changes that we desire in our lives. Your imagination is a source of health, vitality, love, peace, dopamine, excitement, thrill, absolutely anything that you desire! By going within and imagining you are opening up to a new world of possibilities...you are accessing your soul and you can change the very reality you think you are in (which is in reality a dream!).<br>
<br>
  So, do not fear the Coronavirus. Go within and imagine, turn to your source of health and vitality. It is the strongest power on Earth, the strongest power in the universe, the strongest power THERE IS. Because this very power has created absolutely everything you see. This power is you. You are everything, hence you have nothing to fear. You choose what to feel, you choose what to experience. Imagine health and vitality, and health and vitality there will be. Create your imaginary remedies that you hold onto to stay strong through the storm of crisis that's currently going on in this dream we call reality. It is no longer possible to avoid talk about the Coronavirus, hence you need to acknowledge its existence and do so with love, because love dominates--always! Acknowledge the Coronavirus with love and you will fill yourself and your loved ones with a source of health and vitality.<br>
  <br>
  
  Your source within can create anything. Your source within is everything. You're unstoppable! Your power is powerful beyond what you thought possible! Everyone possesses this power, because everyone is God, because everyone has their own reality and manifesting abilities. In fact, you're all illusions that I have created to entertain myself...and I am an illusion that you have created to entertain yourself...let's embrace the entertainment and stop worrying!

        <h3 id="welcome">WELCOME</h3>


        
<p>My name is Noah.  This is my personal site for sharing thoughts 
regarding reality and manifestation.  I have for many years been around 
the weirdest places of the internet: everything from brain training to 
philosophy and meditation.  I finally have a pretty clear image of what I
 believe we are as humans and what we can do to improve our situation.  
All thanks to my lovely friends <strong>Erin &amp; Ainsley</strong>, who introduced me to Neville Goddard. &lt;3  I’m so excited about life now, and am hoping to share this excitement.</p>

<p>Should you have any questions about the content here or a desire to contact me personally, please do so at <em><a href="mailto:noah@godequals.me">noah@godequals.me</a></em>.  I will be happy to hear from you.</p>

<h3 id="neville-goddard">NEVILLE GODDARD</h3>
<p>Neville Goddard’s teachings are the real deal for learning to control
 your life and understanding the mechanics behind reality and 
consciousness.  All his books are available as free PDFs online, check 
out <a href="https://imaginationandfaith.com/neville-goddard-free-pdf-epub-books/">this site</a>.</p>

<h3 id="my-personal-theory">MY PERSONAL THEORY</h3>
<p>I recently created my own piece of manifestation theory based on 
Neville Goddard’s teachings.  I hope this will help you advance your 
understanding of manifestation, simplify it and bring about more inner 
peace to your life.</p>

<h3 id="why-does-music-feel-good">WHY DOES MUSIC FEEL GOOD?</h3>
<p>I love music.  I can listen to a song and become totally euphoric.  I
 would say music and imaginaning are two of my favorite activities in 
life.  Both bring about wonderful emotions and feelings!  The reason 
music feels so good to listen to is because it is literally a person’s 
imagination put into sensory information (sound waves).  When you listen
 to these sound waves, you are experiencing the imagination of another 
person.  It is quite incredible.  Remember though, that there is not 
really any such thing as “another person.”  Everyone else is a product 
of your own wonderful imagination–consciousness.  You’re creating 
everything.  Enjoy!</p>
