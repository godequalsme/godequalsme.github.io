# Welcome to God Equals Me!
### P.S. This is not a narcissistic site, hehe.

My name is Noah.  This is my personal site for sharing thoughts regarding reality and manifestation.  I have for many years been around the weirdest places of the internet when it comes to everything from brain training to philosophy and meditation.  

I finally have what I believe to be a pretty clear image of what I believe we are as humans and what we can do to improve our situation.  All thanks to my lovely friends **Erin & Ainsley**, who introduced me to Neville Goddard. <3

Should you have any questions about the content here or a desire to contact me personally, please do so at noah@godequals.me.  I will be happy to hear from you.
