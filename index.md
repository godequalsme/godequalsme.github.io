### WELCOME

My name is Noah.  This is my personal site for sharing thoughts regarding reality and manifestation.  I have for many years been around the weirdest places of the internet: everything from brain training to philosophy and meditation.  I finally have what I believe to be a pretty clear image of what I believe we are as humans and what we can do to improve our situation.  All thanks to my lovely friends **Erin & Ainsley**, who introduced me to Neville Goddard. <3

Should you have any questions about the content here or a desire to contact me personally, please do so at *[noah@godequals.me](mailto:noah@godequals.me)*.  I will be happy to hear from you.


### NEVILLE GODDARD
Neville Goddard's teachings are the real deal for learning to control your life and understanding the mechanics behind reality and consciousness.  All his books are available as free PDFs online, check out [this site](https://imaginationandfaith.com/neville-goddard-free-pdf-epub-books/).

### MY PERSONAL THEORY
I recently created my own piece of manifestation theory based on Neville Goddard's teachings.  I hope this will help you advance your understanding of manifestation, simplify it and bring about more inner peace to your life.
